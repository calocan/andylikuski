          When I was young, my brother and I liked trains so much that our mother would drive us back and forth along the tracks in
          the hopes of spotting one. Now that I know my railroads I can safely say that the track in question was out of service.
          My first train trip was from Oakland to Seattle (or maybe the other way around) and since then I've take ViaRail across
          Canada, Amtrak across the U.S., a short 35 hour trip from Boston to New Orleans, and I've had three trips to Europe with
          extensive rail use. Trains are elegant and orderly. They are the most environmentally benign form of motorized transportation
          imaginable and scale to almost any circumstance. I don't know if I could live in a city without a rail system or in a town
          with out of train station.

          Like so many children, I was introduced to piano at age six and classically trained. I was never especially talented,
          but I kept at the lessons until I was eighteen. My interests slowly opened up to the world of pop piano music, improv,
          blues, and playing in ensembles. I played keyboards briefly in a couple bands and recently took a couple years of jazz
          lessons. My idol in the piano world is unquestionable Ben Folds, who isn't afraid to sing about someone in particular
          and rock out on the piano while doing it. If I could play like Ben, that's all I would ever do. My other favorite pianist
          is Victor Borge, who I was lucky enough to see live sometime after his 75th birthday (you'll get the joke if you know
          his work.) Masterful piano playing combined with comedy and class has no equal.

          play pop songs and sing along. About half the time I'm playing the Barenaked Ladies, who share the spotlight with Ben

          My father grew up on a farm in Alberta, Canada, and I relish the chance to visit it every summer. Though I never lived there,
          it will always be my second home. I like agrarian values, work, community, and politics. I'm heavily influenced by the writings
          of Wendell Berry, who makes a convincing case for the lifestyle. I don't know if I'll every get to farm, but I want a lot
          more people to do it as a lifestyle. The shift to industrial farming is depressing, but I hope that the revival of localized
          agriculture can attract many of us back out to the fields--maybe me someday.

          L'Hexagone, elle m'intrigue. Childhood trips to Canada meant there was French to read on my cereal box. I developed
          a bit of a crush on the language when I had the chance to learn it in high school. It wasn't until the age of 24 that
          I had my first chance to visit Europe. I dreamt about it for days and finally landed in Paris. It was chaotic and
          my French was all but worthless there. Things improved a bit when we traveled to the south. After several years tackling
          Spanish in my twenties, I decided that I wanted to be fluent in French and Spanish by the age of 30. I took courses in
          French at the Alliance Française in Berkeley and San Fracisco and got serious about language acquisition techniques.
          As with Spanish and German, I made good use of the Foreign Service Institute language courses to hone my skills. I moved to
          Montréal several years ago to really conquer French, but fate pulled me elsewhere prematurely. I remain fluent only
          in English, but my French skills are solid, and I love going anywhere Francophone.
