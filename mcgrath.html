<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mayor:</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your strategy for redevelopment of the entire McGrath corridor must complement economic and social opportunities with the emergencies of climate change and public health. East Somerville has few real obstacles to redevelopment--Assembly Square, Union Square, and East Broadway are your target zones for this decade and the Inner Belt will likely see substantial development shortly thereafter. They will all soon feature high quality transit and excellent accessibility to Boston, west Somerville, and Cambridge. The only difficult obstacle to socially and environmentally responsible redevelopment is the excess of vehicular traffic.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">From a public health perspective, you need to limit local and regional use of vehicles through East Somerville neighborhoods. Gains that accompany rail transit expansion will not be sufficient alone to curtail vehicle pollution, danger, and poor use of public space. Your plan must accomplish a significant overall reduction of Somerville based automobile trips and move as much traffic as possible off of Route 28 and onto I93. Interstate 93 is a significant health problem for Somerville, but it is better isolated from Somerville&rsquo;s neighborhoods than Route 28. Vehicles that must remain on McGrath after redevelopment should by in large be limited to those conducting business in East Somerville neighborhoods.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your preferred approach of converting McGrath Hwy from an elevated structure to a boulevard will move a significant number of trips fully or partially off of Route 28. As of the pre-Big Dig 2003 survey, about 42% of travelers originated from communities north of Somerville with the majority having destinations in Somerville and Cambridge. Slowing McGrath will encourage some trips to partially or fully avoid McGrath. Such a shift in behavior can be accomplished with negligible increases in driving time. See Appendix X for sample trip alternatives.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By far, your largest obstacle to trip reduction will be local trips along McGrath, accounting for the remaining 58% of trips as of the 2003 survey. The only way to maintain tolerable driving conditions on a McGrath Boulevard is to create a comprehensive transit network in East Somerville that is much more economic than driving. By advocating demolition of the elevated portions of McGrath, you have negotiating power with the State of Massachusetts. I propose that you divert the state reconstruction funds to create a free MBTA transit zone in East Somerville. This will give you the following sizable benefits:</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<ol class="c11" start="1">
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Overwhelming support from East Somerville citizens and businesses.</span></li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Decreased traffic along the Route 28 zone, making the boulevard redevelopment feasible.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Major reduction in state expenditures for a new elevated structure or road improvements to support a reduced-traffic McGrath boulevard.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Increased demand for the new Green Line service and better use of the Broadway transit routes. This will decrease headways for both branches of the Green Line, creating more satisfied customers in both East and West Somerville and possibly raising revenue from West Somerville and Medford riders. This is a win for Somerville and the State, as it will better justify the State&rsquo;s expenditures on the Green Line.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">New transit service on Route 28 from Assembly Square to Lechmere will be well used.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Draw developers, businesses, and new residents to the redevelopment projects at Union Square and Assembly Square. The new Assembly Square Orange Line station can maintain fares, but transit from Assembly Square down Route 28 should be free to build ridership of the bus line.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Create new development zones at Gilman Square and the remainder of the Inner Belt.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Economic Justice for low-income residents in East Somerville and incentive to sell their cars.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Riders outside East Somerville will ride free from East Somerville, encouraging more carfree commerce within East Somerville, especially in Union Square.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">The free transit zone can sunset after the initial funds are exhausted. The zone should be guaranteed for at least ten years after the opening of the Green Line and seek a permanent funding source with East Somerville developer and business partnerships.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span
            class="c0">Create a stronger demand for the Urban Ring and other transit improvements.</span></li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">Innovation that will create more good press for Somerville.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By packaging a Route 28 boulevard plan with a free public transit zone, you can maximize traffic reduction and costly new infrastructure. You will be able to significantly reduce the number of lanes of traffic and sell the development rights of the space saved along the new boulevard. [show overhead view of boulevard] The innovative plan can also be used to qualify for federal Small Starts funding for increased transit through the East Somerville corridors [verify]</span>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Funding Comparisons</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Comparison: San Francisco Central Freeway</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">When the San Francisco Central Freeway was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Federal Highway Administration allocation $40 in emergency funds for seismic upgrade. A later city ballot measure approved $67 million for retrofiting. When a later proposition to build a boulevard overrode the retrofit, funding to construct Octavia Boulevard in place of the northern portion of the Central Freeway was estimated at $25 to $35 million (Napolitan, 2007). However, this cost was more than compensated by the selling of excess land around the boulevard: &ldquo;The removal of this freeway freed up nine acres of land. The sale of that land paid for all the construction of the boulevard and it&rsquo;s generated surpluses&rdquo;
    (Streetfilms | San Francisco: Removal of the Embarcadero Freeway, 2006)</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Comparison: San Francisco Embarcadero Freeway</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The San Francisco Embarcadero Freeway was also damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. Long held support for dismantling the freeway resurfaced and succeeded in replacing the structure with the Embarcadero Boulevard. The estimated cost of rebuilding the elevated freeway would have been $69.5 million. The boulevard cost less than $50 million (San Francisco&#39;s Embarcadero | Congress for the New Urbanism). Space saved by the boulevard was allocated to a two-way historic streetcar line, bicycle lanes, wide sidewalks, and public spaces.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Funding McGrath Boulevard and the East Somerville Free Transit Zone</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two San Francisco examples demonstrate that tens of millions of dollars in savings are at play when &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;
    an elevated structure to a boulevard. Additionally capital funding emerges from selling saved land. Though East Somerville is not comparable to San Francisco neighborrhoods, the construction savings are applicable, as is the capability to vastly improve the social and economic conditions.</span>

<p class="c2 c10"><span class="c0">McGrath Highway (formerly the Northern Artery) was completed in 1928 in order to provide a high-speed connection between the Charles and Mystic Rivers, rerouting Route 28 off local streets in Cambridge and Somerville. It was upgraded as an elevated highway in the 1950&rsquo;s Over the next 10 years the highway will need to be substantially reconstructed, or torn down. If it is to be reconstructed, there will be significant capacity reductions for a number of years. (from assignment)</span>

US 1 and Route 28 were relocated off of local streets in Cambridge and Somerville onto the Northern Artery when it opened to traffic. From the Boston University Bridge, the two routes used Memorial Drive and Cambridge Parkway to reach the Northern Artery.

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Existing population density is very high in Somerville, where approximately 75,000 residents live in an area of four square miles, and also high along Route 28&rsquo;s middle section. Population density along the study corridor is lowest in the northern segment, from the Mystic River Bridge to Mystic Avenue; it is 1,200 people per square mile in the Mystic View neighborhood. In the middle section, between Mystic Avenue and Medford Street, it ranges from 1,200 to 12,000 people per square mile. Along its lower segment, from Medford Street to Museum Way, population density in East Cambridge is about 6,500 people per square mile. The densest areas of residential population contain multifamily residential buildings, including high-rise apartments. (Route28FinalReport.pdf)</span>

They believe that Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and state agencies must engage in planning strategies such as zoning, master plans, design guidelines, preservation or creation of open spaces, parking management, programs for bicycling, for sidewalks, and for recreational paths, transportation demand management programs, and traffic calming to promote effective and functional urban design plans along the corridor that preserve the human scale in its neighborhoods and commercial districts.

Also, it did not show that Route 28, in the study area, is used on a regular basis as an alternative to I-93 southbound by traffic destined to the various neighborhoods in Boston, although this is probably the case on days that there are incidents on I-93. In closing, Route 28 is used for local and regional traffic, consistent with its designation as &ldquo;other freeway&rdquo;; however, it still provides local access to business/residences, as a principal arterial does. &nbsp;(Route28FinalReport)</span>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">8.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;INTERNAL CIRCULATION</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As with the Assembly Square District, where an internal circulation system was also studied, an internal roadway system will have to be planned for the McGrath Corridor District, the Inner Belt District, and possibly the North Point development, including interconnections among them. For example, a &ldquo;Brickbottom Boulevard&rdquo;
    could be created in the largely abandoned MBTA right-of- way that formerly was used by the Lowell/New Hampshire Line. This could form part of a connector road system parallel to Route 28 that would connect Charleston Avenue (Gilmore Bridge) to Washington Street behind North Point and between the McGrath Corridor and the Inner Belt District. (Route28FinalReport)</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The traffic volume pattern and intensity of the roadway would of course be important factors in determining the feasibility of reconstructing it as a boulevard that intersects Washington Street at grade. In order to bring about significant traffic volume reductions, a variety of measures would be required that could include improved public transportation, improved incident management on I- 93, a direct I-93 connection to Brickbottom and East Cambridge, and policies promoting trip reduction, growth management, and parking limitation. Some of these ideas are already under study in the form of the Urban Ring, the Green Line extension, and the Orange Line station at Assembly Square. (Route28FinalReport)</span>

</ol>
<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Deconstruction of the elevated portion of McGrath could occur after the Green Line extension opens. Deconstruction would occur in segments:</span>
</p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol class="c6" start="1">
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">With the opening of the Assembly Square development, add a new MBTA line between Assembly Square and Lechmere station via McGrath.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">With commencement of work on McGrath, create the East Somerville Free Transit zone.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">If traffic modeling is not adequate to test the upcoming road closures and lane reductions, the city and state may choose to conduct detour tests and lane closure tests and measure the changes in traffic. This may show the need for different traffic detours or additional transit incentives.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Deconstruct the portion of the elevated structure north of Washington Street. Washington Street remains open an serves as a detour to I93. Reroute bus service on McGrath to parallel local streets.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Convert north of Washington Street streets and area previously below the structure to the boulevard design.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Deconstruct the portion of the elevated south of Washington Street, leaving Washington St. open if possible.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Again, convert the uncovered area to the boulevard design.</span></li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">If not yet complete, deconstruct the potion of the structure that is over Washington Street and close Washington St. through access. It may be possible to permit connectivity between one or both sides of Washington St. and one or both directions of McGrath using the access and egress lanes that are farthest from the elevated structure. If the intersection must fully close than traffic can be detoured to Somerville Ave for south access. A more complicated detour will be needed for north access.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Complete the boulevard with new intersection at Washington St. and McGrath Boulevard.</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Upgrade transit on Washington St. (MBTA 91 bus) to create a right-of-way from Sullivan Station, Brickbottom Station, Union Square, and beyond to Inman and Central Square in Cambridge.</span>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol class="c6" start="7">
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0 c3">Predict outcomes, benefits, costs, impacts</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Traffic Impacts:</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reconstruction of McGrath will lead to an immediate reduction of traffic along McGrath. Any drivers who used McGrath as an alternative to I93 will cease to do so. Regional drivers with destinations in Somerville and Cambridge will probably use the suggested detours. Some may permanently switch routes with the permanent reduction of lane capacity on McGrath. Local traffic will continue to use the portions of McGrath that remain open during construction. The opening of the greenline will convert some local drivers to transit. Without an urban ring, few regional drivers will switch to transit. The creation of the East Somerville Free Transit zone will convert additional drivers to transit.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The new McGrath boulevard will support significantly less trips than the existing configuration. With four total traffic lanes open to commuters during rush hour, McGrath will maintain &#8532; of its lane capacity on the currently unelevated sections and 100% of its lane capacity on the currently elevated portion. The new at-grade intersections at Somerville Ave. and Washington St. will decrease throughput on McGrath, but may have a useful traffic metering effect. Limiting speeds on the boulevard to 30mph will also slow throughput. Outside of commuting hours, two lanes of McGrath will be dedicated to transit, improving access to Assembly Square and other developments. </span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Benefits:</span></p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reduced traffic and reduced traffic speeds will decrease pollution and danger to drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Parcels along the boulevard will become more appealing to retail use. </span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<ol class="c6" start="8">
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0 c3">Consider operation and maintenance of facilities, services</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Operation and maintenance of the boulevard will be less than the elevated structures. New bus service from Assembly Square to Lechmere will be free throughout Somerville and possibly free from Lechmere.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<ol class="c6" start="9">
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0 c3">Evaluate alternatives</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is probably no politically feasible alternative to a boulevard, and likely nothing more than four lanes will be tolerated. There is the danger of using much of the saved space for on street parking. On-street parking will accomplish some traffic slowdowns but has more disadvantages than advantage. This space is better reallocated for safe cycle tracks and better sidewalk area. A six lane road would propagate the unsatisfactory urban conditions that exist on McGrath at Broadway.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A viable alternative to the Free Transit zone would be to issue transit passes to all East Somerville residents. Though this option would give East Somerville residents a greater advantage than simply a free zone, it would create more political problems. First, a non-arbitrary definition of East Somerville residents is more difficult than creating a zone where all users ride free. It would also fail to give outsider any incentive to shop and recreate in East Somerville. With the free transit zone, outsiders would have some incentive to come to destinations like Union Square by transit, knowing they could have the departing trip for free.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A no-free transit alternative would result in more traffic from local trips. It would eliminate the opportunity to decrease headways on the new Green Line extensions. It would also eliminate the potential one-way fare revenue from new riders who road outside the zone from East Somerville or into East Somerville from outside. Somerville might be able to convince the state to fund more improvements to the boulevard with the money saved by not rebuilding the elevated structure, rather than asking the state to commit that money to a free transit zone. However, being a state road, the state will already be funding the boulevard itself. It makes more sense to dedicate the cost savings of a boulevard to increasing demand for the road with free transit, than to use the saved money to make the boulevard better in other ways.</span>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can build a strong constiuency with most East Somerville businesses and developers by creating an attractive boulevard and free transit zone. You should also have strong support from the citizens of East Somerville, except for those who support the current McGrath configuration and do not use transit. I believe that the residents of West Somerville will also support this plan. They will derive some benefit from free transit in East Somervile and support the improvement on McGrath. I believe the Somerville Chamber of Commerce will support the development plans for a McGrath boulevard. The the broad group of citizen and business supporter to lobby the state to dedicate save capital funding to the transit zone. [Look for precedents] You will find it useful to crate an advocacy group supported by the aforementioned supporters called something to the effect of East Somerville Free Transit Zone Solution. </span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Certain community organizations will strongly favor this proposal, like East Somerville Main Streets and the Somerville Community Corportation. Make sure to use these reach to build public support priory to sending the proposal to the state.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your enemies will mainly be the businesses along McGrath that most benefit from its current easy access, such as the Target. You will also likely see resistance from the other businesses along McGrath whose buildings may loose visibility if development rights are sold along the shrunken roadway. You will have to be sensitive to some of these businesses, strategically configuring new parcels or leaving some areas as open space to maintain visibility. You may also experience resistance from some commuters who use McGrath, but I think the new configuration can be sold to them on the grounds of decreasing the overall traffic.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You policy should be supported by Cambridge. Cambridge has an equal interest in redeveloping Route 28 into a smaller boulevard to benefit its developments at North Point and East Cambridge. Engage the mayor and Cambridge Chamber of Commerce early with your plans. A coordinated plan with Cambridge to narrow McGrath/Obrien to a boulevard would make a stronger case to the state.</span>
</p>

<p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though the state will be supportive of the boulevard, it is unlikely that they will react well to funding a free transit zone with the money saved on the boulevard. It is essential that you have a strong support base to present to the state. Make sure to apply to the federal Small Starts program for the dedicated McGrath Boulevard bus lane in order to improve your case with the state. Demonstrating the possibly of federal capital to support the transit zone will be very valuable to justifying the transit zone. </span>
