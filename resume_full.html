<br/><b><i>Thesis</i></b>
<br/><br/>Authored a software plugin called <i>Rescape</i> for Google Sketchup to simplify the use of Sketchup for pedestrian and transit-oriented neighborhood redesigns. The plugin simplifies the most essential tasks of doing a site redesign for an existing neighborhood. It enables downloading and rendering the streets of any neighborhood and provides tools to draw amenities such as streetcar tracks and bike lanes in 3D. <br/>Beta software releases: <a href=" http://code.google.com/p/rescape/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/rescape/downloads/list</a>. <br/>Thesis paper about the project: <a href="http://www.likuski.org/thesis.pdf">http://www.likuski.org/thesis.pdf</a>.
