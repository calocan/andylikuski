        <b>Introduction</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Urban digital displays, or urban screens, are taking on an increasing breadth of roles in public spaces. It is common to rely on digital displays for transit arrival times, time and temperature, and increasingly we are exposed to the will of government and businesses with digital art displays, product advertisements, and television broadcasts. Given the natural growth in urban digital displays that parallel screen technology and information technology curves, how can we best exploit these powerful public disseminators of information toward promoting sustainability? More specifically, what sorts of information are best suited for display in public to raise sustainability awareness, promote sustainable behavior, and pressure government to pursue sustainable policy and practices? The public has private access to a wide range of sustainability data online, but often this data is not specific to their location or it is not data that the average citizen would think or choose to seek out. Urban screens have the unique ability to broadcast dynamic information to the public--possibly relevant to their spatial or temporal context. Just as banks can show us the current temperature or stock prices, a digital display could show us the current pollution levels where it is situated or the city's current energy usage. Additionally screens could give us relevant social sustainability indicators--perhaps current unemployment and job creation statistics or a yearly graph of local child reading level versus national trends.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are two primary categories for urban screens, those that are interactive and those that are not. Interaction may be enabled via a touch screen or an individual's mobile device. For our purposes, I will restrict the discussion to non-interactive screens. This both places a limit on the myriad of existing usages and opportunities and also helps us focus our attention on influencing the public at large rather than furnishing an individual with privately sought information. There are other necessary limitations to this discussion. I will not focus on screen technology, placement, cost, or the externalities of energy usage and light and noise pollution. I will also avoid discussing the aesthetic and architectural considerations of screens. We can assume that the screens mentioned will be in a relevant public space--a town square, transit station, or beside a busy roadway--and that the screen will take an orthodox form, either on a post, suspended from above, on the face of a building, etc. I will also limit the discussion to usages of the screen as a public service directly related to sustainability. Though advertisements and digital art installations may have tangential relationships to sustainability, they usually have other purposes. I will, however, consider usages that promote sustainable local businesses, assuming that the businesses may supply but not control the information that is displayed.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to what information should be displayed on a screen, we need to determine how that information should be displayed relative to other information. Depending on the size of the screen, it may be possible to visualize multiple data on the same screen. It may be preferable to alternate data displays based on the relative importance or temporal significance. For instance, transit arrival times would take precedence over yearly transportation expenditure data--the former is more temporally relevant though the latter may be more important in terms of sustainability awareness. Some displays may visualize only one data set continuously, while others may cycle through related data sets or present a cornucopia of diverse material.
        <br>
        <br>
        I will divide our exploration into the three aforementioned categories--<a href="#awarness">sustainability awareness</a>, <a href="#behavior">encouraging sustainable behavior</a>, and <a href="#officials">pressuring government</a>--and further subdivide each category into usages that are already common, those that are unique and innovative, and usages that do not yet exist that could be valuable. Since this is an exercise in appraising visual data it is appropriate to make the presentation as visual as possible. Thus whenever possible, I will include an example image or design of the usage at hand. I will exclude animations and programmatic behavior due to time constraints, but such functionality should be assumed when viewing the "screen-shots". After the exploration I will discuss the merits and feasibility of the various usages discussed and then make recommendations for implementing the best ideas.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fundamentally we want to demonstrate the externalities of societal behavior, both costs and benefits, in order 
        to help citizens and decision-makers understand and act in favor of social and environmental sustainability that may not correspond with their private interests or previous knowledge. To make the screens into successful social marketing tools, we further need to reduce the perceived barriers or inertia of changing behavior by incentivizing the new behavior (McKenzie-Mohr and Smith 1999). Evaluating the effectiveness of each urban screen display idea requires having a system of measurement. Though we can cannot quantify any measurement without extensive real-world evaluation, we can rely on indexed sustainability principles to judge the qualifications of each urban screen idea. Therefore, I will associate each idea with zero or more sustainability items from three sustainability indexes. The first are the <i>Melbourne Principles for Sustainable Cities</i>, which are listed above in the right margin. Next is the Genuine Progress Indicator, listed below the Melbourne Principles, which contrasts the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by measuring income distribution, pollution, changes in leisure time, and several other indicators. Finally, I will specify whether each idea positively addresses one of the three measurements of the (Un)happy Planet Index--life expectancy, life satisfaction, and ecological footprint (referenced below the Genuine Progress Indicator list.) Each index's items are appended with a code (in blue) that will be listed below screen illustrations or in the text. The qualifications, along with their intensity, will help determine my recommendations for actual implementation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before beginning, I should note that following ideas have a small predilection for encouraging transit use and eliminating cars. I personally believe that this transition is of the highest priority for citizens, and therefore deserves the most attention. There is no other single behavior modification that can have such profound impacts on environmental and socially-just sustainability, despite that cars are transitioning to electric power. In addition to the colossal pollution of cars, their social and environmental impact in terms of material costs, land use, city and streetscape damage, segregation and isolation, mobility injustice, health, oil wars, and energy wastefulness make all other citizen behavior shifts pale in comparison. This "elephant in the room" is too often neglected in academic and popular writing on sustainability, where prescriptions for remedy address more symptomatic problems instead of targeting the core problem whose elimination would cascade into the largest number of environmental and social justice sustainability gains. Film maker Michael Moore has a thought-provoking <a target="ref" href="http://www.truthout.org/060109A">proposition</a>
        about eliminating car-use in the United States, and although his rural solution is impractical, the plan is worth consideration (http://www.truthout.org/060109A). Additionally, J.H. Crawford has written an excellent book, <a target="ref" href="http://www.carfree.com/book/index.htm"><i>Carfree Cities</i></a>
        (http://www.carfree.com/book/index.htm) and design manual <a target="ref" href="http://www.carfree.com/cdm/index.html"<i>Carfree Design Manual</i></a>
        (http://www.carfree.com/cdm/index.html) on creating car-free cities and modifying cities to become car-free.

        <a name="awareness"></a>
        <b>Raising sustainability awareness</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Much of the relevant sustainability information that can be displayed on a screen does not lead to direct behavior change but may
        be valuable in raising the social consciousness. This in turn could indirectly influence a person's ancillary activities, such as voting, charity, or community participation. For example, a time span graph of the city's child literacy rates versus juvenile detention might not change the way a person raises their child, but may lead to more socially progressive voting on education or childcare funding. A chart of greenhouse gas emissions per industrialized country and the country's corresponding climate reduction strategies might help people understand that the United States disproportionately emits greenhouse gases and in turn support climate change legislation. We must be wary of the weakness of an indirect and impersonal educational experience versus the behavior-modifying examples that I will describe in the next section. Rajecki and other researchers warn of the lack of correlation of indirect experience with attitude and behavior (Rajecki 1982). However, thought-provoking statistics are a form of social marketing, and clarifying misconceptions with factual and straight-forward data may reduce the public misunderstandings that hamper pro-environmental efforts (Marcell, Agyeman, and Rappaport 2004, 169-189).

        One common type of display that raises sustainability awareness are the "shocking counter" displays, such as an up-to-date estimate of the world's population and the forever-increasing U.S. debt along with each citizen's share. The original intent of these displays may have been to shock or anger, but nowadays they are excellent indicators of sustainability, raising awareness both with the absolute quantities they display and the speed at which they increase. Large numbers may be difficult to relate to daily life, so including the percent increase per day or the amount per capita (for the debt counter) is useful.

        Another common display of information that enables sustainability awareness is that of public event calendars. It is common to see events advertised at the facility where they will occur (such as a school) and also to see the public events occurring throughout a town or city listed in a central location, like city hall. Though many of these displays were traditional marquees, many are now converting to LED or LCD displays, allowing their content to be updated remotely and display more information. Highlighting community events promotes the distinctive characteristics of a city as well as community cooperation, and may raise sustainability awareness in diverse ways.

        <br>
        
        Fund raising drives are yet another commonly seen display that promotes sustainability. They are typically updated by hand by painting a thermometer's mercury or an analogous representation.

		Fund raising displays raise awareness about an issue or project that is typically local. They provide a clear objective and method for achieving that objective. Fund raisers overlap into promoting sustainable behavior by promoting cooperation and often attempt to correct social injustices, such as a lack of school funding. Fund-raising sometimes personalizes the giving experience by acknowledging high contributers with mounted plaques and other forms of public gratitude. This simple strategy reduces the problem of the tragedy of the commons, transfering a public asset that citizens expect others to support into a pseudo-private one.

        A powerful way to promote sustainability is by increasing communication with other cultures. An innovative project by Maki Ueda in 2003 called <i>Hole in the Earth </i>bridged the Dutch city of Rotterdam with the city of </span>Bandung, Indonesia by connecting a video and audio feed over broadband internet and displaying it in a public space of each city. Passers-by were able to peer through the ground-mounted "Holes in the Earth" and communicate with their foreign counterparts. The possibilities of this project are limitless. When I shared the project with Bret Victor, a user interface designer, he suggested a multiple portal idea as shown on the right, with the added features of written interaction and translation services. The project satisfies the criteria of distinctiveness of place, participation, and cooperation, and additionally requires good governance to permit uncensored communication that could be used for activism and protest. Deeply interactive cultural exchanges may promote altruism, empathy, and prosocial behaviors that, according to Kollmuss and Agyeman and others, may be prerequisites for pro-environmental and presumably pro-social justice behavior (Kollmuss and Agyeman 2002, 239-260).

		a certain vapor color changes in porportion to the pollutant level change, where 10sg (specific gravity or relative density) is the density when below the admitted limit and 30sg is the density when above the admitted limit (In the Air Project, 2009). Though not a screen this prototype has the potential to have a powerful impact on people's perceptions of urban air pollution, linking in the sustainability criteria of production and consumption and ecological footprint. Such a prototype could be downsized or converted to a screen display for cheaper distribution purposes, but visualizing the pollution as colored vapor densities is probably the most powerful, and it hints at a future of three-dimensional visualizations.

        Some existing usages of informational screens migh be extended to provide awareness to additional sustainability topics. One can imagine a plethora of statistics reporting on pollution, water levels, and other quantities that would penetrate the public consciousness. For instance, an urban screen could report daily greenhouse gas emissions for the city compared to its daily goal for the time of year. 
				
		Being more relevant to its situation, a screen could report real-time noise levels, dividing them by decibel level or sound frequency to indicate car and truck noise, background ventilation noise, leaf-blowers, etc.

		Another fascinating chart would be the real-time percentage of visitors to a commercial area arriving on foot, bike, bus, or car, which could be estimated by using various sensors. Such data could help merchants see the significance of non-auto business or encourage drivers to switch modes.
		
		 We may also be interested in displaying more information about natural events besides temperature, such as the moon phase or visible planets, a neighborhood creek map to illuminate overpaving, or perhaps a summary of bird species expected to migrate through the city during a given week. Helping people connect to their natural environment would indirectly green the city and might enlighten those whose environmental upbringing denied them of these "luxuries". We could also show political campaign candidate profiles or election results to improve citizen participate and responsible governance.

        in New York City (http://urbanneighbors.nypl.org/browse.cfm)), or surpluses and shortages in food crops. There are endless possibilities for statistics and all ideas should be considered for their educational benefit and usefulness as sustainability indicators. We should be careful in distinguishing what is a useful indicator versus what is simply educational. As Brugman warns about Seattle, Washington's indicators, those that are overly simplistic or do show long-term progress are not useful as indicators (Brugmann 1997, 59).

        We could also extend event calendars to be more socially sustainable, offering important information about less glamorous topics than concert performances, perhaps information about free medical screenings, permit-approved protests and rallies, soup-kitchens, and senior-center events. Such information may benefit underrepresented groups disproportionately and would thus have greater individual social benefit than entertainment events for the wealthier classes. It might also promote volunteering and raise cross-class, race, age, gender, and sexual-orientation awareness.

            <br>
            Encouraging sustainable behavior may or may not raise sustainability awareness. In the long-term it is likely better if citizens are aware of the sustainable aspects of their behavior so that they do not switch to a worse behavior due to economics, social pressures, etc. Such a problem is common for gas conservation, which occurs for economic reasons more often than sustainability reasons, leading to a return to wastefulness when gas prices fall. However, we have to be willing to accept sustainable behavior regardless of the motivations (unless the motivation is tied to another sustainability issue, like poverty.) If we manage to change behavior and raise awareness at the same time, it is icing on the cake. The following display usages having varying levels of sustainable awareness versus behavior impact. Transit arrival data eases transit use but rarely raises awareness, whereas a display of litter levels around town may greatly raise awareness but only refine behavior marginally.

            Real-time transit data is probably the most common use of digital screens to encourage sustainable behavior. Many metro, rail, and bus systems display arrival estimates at the station or stop so that riders know how long to expect to wait. Increasingly the same data is available online, via SMS (text messaging), or by phoning an automated service. There are some minor nuisances to this technology: Metro systems often force passengers to enter the fare gates before they can see arrival times. Bus systems are prone to be missing data for certain buses, leading to infuriation when a bus is predicted in 30 minutes and one arrives much sooner when the passenger has moved away from the stop. Accurate real-time information enables riders to be confident in arrival times, which is especially valuable for congestion-vulnerable bus service. It additionally promotes accountability for the transit operator, since riders can more easily demand explanations for late service when the lateness is clearly displayed. Thus real-time information allows riders to reduce their footprint by taking tranist; it encourages the community participation and cooperation fundamental to transit service; it also increases safety, leisure time, and overall life satisfaction for its users.

        Some innovation has occurred surrounding vehicle parking in an effort to reduce congestion and overall miles driven. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) metro system in the San Francisco Bay Area experimented with digital signs along the freeway approaching a BART station, which alerted people of the number of parking spaces left at the station. Drivers could in turn exit the freeway and ride BART from Oakland to San Francisco rather than driving an additional 15 miles along a congested corridor and toll bridge crossing. Though such a system may encourage driving by giving drivers more options, it at least can reduce driving when a commuter is determined to drive regardless. Another improvement for real-time transit displays is to distribute screens to local businesses near transit. Riders sitting in a coffee shop, for instance, can then wait until the train or bus's estimated arrival to leave the shop.

    Another innovation in California is the use of freeway displays to post "amber alerts" about child abductions. When a child abduction occurs, all digital freeway signs in the area display information about the suspected abductor's car so that drivers can call in any sightings. The displays, when used sparingly, can marginally improve sustainability through cooperation. Such a system could also be used for major crime alerts, missing persons, etc. on metro and bus systems.

    One intriguing improvement to real-time transit displays would be to display the estimated arrival times for various prominent destinations. California already does this on its freeways to show drivers the estimated time to popular destinations (drawing time data from bridge toll payment transmitters in cars that travel from one bridge to another.) Though its use on freeways may occasionally discourage driving in favor of mass transit, it by-in-large makes driving easier and thus has negative impacts for sustainability. A similar display for public transit would encourage sustainable mobility and also help riders use transit routes with which they are not familiar. Bus routes can be visualized to give them the familiarity of a rail route. Adding estimated arrival time makes real-time displays much more valuable to riders. It would probably be prudent to limit destinations to those that are served directly by transit, as opposed to locations requiring a lengthy walk.

    One problem with making a bus route look like a metro line is that it conceals the number of intermediate stops, whose large number often makes bus riding frustrating for regular users and unappealing for prospective ones. Perhaps arrival time displays would make riders think more in terms of major stops and thus enable the elimination of minor stops that are near major ones. More importantly, making the bus line look more like a metro line might encourage officials to give buses full right-of-way--giving them dedicated lanes or roads and the ability to change traffic signals. The best outcome would be for major bus lines to be converted to modern streetcar, metro, or light-rail with full-right-of way in order to eliminate the inherent limitations of a bus. Cities and metropolitan areas could even have ridership contests to see which route wins upgrade to a better transit system, and thus address the social justice problems often associated with metro distribution. Each real-time display at a bus stop could show how many more yearly rides are needed to upgrade the service. This might encourage people to increase their bus use and favor it over driving in order to get an upgrade. All kinds of wonderful social marketing could drive participation in a fund-raiser-style campaign (where the fund-raising is simply taking the bus.) Bicyclists, scooter riders, etc. who would potentially use an upgraded system should be counted as riders toward reaching the goal, but drivers would have to prove willing to use the bus to earn points toward getting an upgrade.

    Often sustainable behavior is economically profitable. There are many opportunities for individuals to make sustainable investments that have a long-term payoff, or even a short-term gain. When a government subsidy is added into the mix the offer is even more enticing.

	Unfortunately access to this information is often limited by underfunded public campaigns. A public screen could show savings for energy efficiency, from light bulbs to insulation upgrades and solar panel installations. By coupling projects with their government subsidies and simple step-by-step implementation list, citizens might be persuaded to take action. An insulation upgrade proposal could begin by showing potential profit by subtracting the economic savings from the cost of installation or upgrade. Then it would display locations for purchase and installation, followed by subsidy reimbursement information, if necessary.

    With the useful advent of congestion pricing in downtown areas like London and Stockholm, there are new opportunities to draw drivers from their cars to transit. One such method would be to show drivers who are paying the congestion fee which transit projects their fee is funding, and what transit is currently available to them as an alternate commute. The display could even offer coupon codes to allow drivers to purchase monthly transit passes at a one-time discount.

    Recycling information could also have important implications for behavior modification. Though most people know they can recycle cans and bottles, they may not realize how many plastics can be recycled at the curb-side, or that compost can go into their green waste bin. Additionally they may not know where to take less disposable items like electronic waste and rechargeable batteries. A clear display of recyclable items would likely make recycling more intuitive. It might also be helpful to add landfill statistics to the items in question. Citizens should know that <i>N</i>
    percentage and <i>M</i>
    tons of recyclable plastic is needlessly thrown in the garbage each week. The displays could also include garbage quantities around town versus state, country or international rates plus the percentage of recycling and landfill usage to encourage better behavior.

    Local shops and businesses have the most visible presence in the high density squares and intersections where most urban screens are situated. In order to both increase support for the screens and make them more useful, the screens should highlight local shops and businesses that are participating in or encouraging sustainable behavior.

	For instance, any store that gives discounts to customers that arrive by foot, bike, or transit deserve mention on the screen. The displays would have to be limited to the shop's name, location, and merit for deserving display. Any advertising beyond this would be abusive commercialization. Local businesses that performed sustainably would also earn display, and the criteria would increase as more businesses acted sustainably. For instance, if one local restaurant composted all of their food waste, they would win mention. But if all restaurants more or less did so, only the restaurants that were generating less overall waste, limiting their energy and water usage, etc, would earn display. As I will discuss later, many of these judgements would be difficult to render and would have to be made as simple to calculate and noncontroversial as possible. Some sustainable initiatives, like purchasing energy from green energy providers or donating food to charity, would be much easier to measure and reward.

    As a simple extension to traditional fund-raising "thermometer" displays, digital displays could present easy options to make donations on the spot. The display could offer a number to text from a cellphone that responded with a donation request. The amount indicated by the donator would be added to their cellular telephone bill, or charged directly to a credit card if the donator had previously set up a charitable giving account. All donations would be reported to the donator at the end of the year to ease claiming tax deductions.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the food realm, screens should display in-season produce, as mentioned earlier, but also display where to buy the produce at local shops along with price. This data would be inputted by grocers, markets, etc. and food would be limited by one or more criteria like "localness" and growing method (conventional versus organic). Car-free directions to all stores should be displayed. Stores might also gain listing preference that are closer and have higher percentages of shoppers that arrive without cars. Hopefully this would have a minor impact on ecological footprint with respect to food origins and directing people to local markets instead of driving.

    <b>Pressuring decision-makers</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of the techniques currently in use for pressuring decision-makers are not urban displays, since they are usually controlled by government or business. One exception is politically active businesses that have a means of dynamically displaying information. This is typically limited to local businesses, as larger organizations cannot afford to display contentious opinions, or they have underlying commercial motivations for their opinions, which disqualifies them from our discussion.

    The most common pressuring technique, though still relatively rare, is by local businesses and religious institutions that have a way of displaying information to the public. Schools may also participate concerning education issues or extreme political events like war and natural disaster, but they are usually limited by their governmental affiliations.

    Some displays are used in a positive way to show an organization is acting responsibly. The most recollectable are "number of days without an accident" signs at construction sites, factories, mines, etc. where displaying the sign both reassures the public and pressures everyone involved in an operation to think about safety.

    <b><i>Innovative ways of pressuring decision-makers</i></b>
    <br>
    Though there are doubtlessly innovative non-digital displays for pressuring decision-makers, they are most often temporary signs displayed by protesters. It is likely that as LCD-type urban screens become more popular, more innovative pressuring tactics will emerge. Many local businesses and churches that display information will likely upgrade to LCD-type screens in the future, which will open the doors to more creative means of pressuring officials.

    Competition between municipalities might be a good way to pressure decision-makers to act sustainably. Such activities that can be implemented by any municipality, such as tree planting, energy saving, and bike lane striping, could motivate public officials directly and via citizen demands to "beat" other municipalities. The best contests would be between municipalities with similar sizes, but perhaps having two differing demographics competing would increase environmental justice awareness.

    An area's walkability is strong indicator of sustainability, especially since it is proportional to car-usage. By displaying a neighborhood's walk score, as calculated by the excellent site <a target="ref" href="http://walkscore.com">walkscore.com</a>, citizens could pressure their public officials to make improvements to improve their neighborhoods walkability. Competition between neighborhoods and cities would further accelerate the pedestrianization of neighborhoods. Another way of empowering citizens to pressure their leaders is using screens to display reported broken infrastructure. There are existing online examples such as <a target="ref" href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/">http://www.fixmystreet.com/</a>
    that allows citizens to report infrastructure problems.

    There are some rather striking statistics that might but pressure on officials if displayed to the public. In terms of land use, a display of parking spaces per capita in the city could pressure a policy change, since learning that some cities have around six spots per car tends to be infuriating. Similarly, a screen could show the percentage of paved area versus green space in order to pressure officials to reduce asphalt coverage and replace it with water-absorbing surfaces. Displaying such information might encourage citizens to request that their residential streets are narrowed and replaced with green berms, as is common in Portland, Oregon. It may also encourage zoning changes to enable car-free leases where citizens agree not to own a car so that a new apartment or condo complex can avoid dedicating valuable space to parking.

        <a name="analysis"></a>
        <b>Analysis of merits and feasibility of the topics discussed</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        From all of the different urban screen usages discussed, it becomes clear that sustainability has many fronts that can targeted broadly or narrowly. Many of the screen usages positively target various sustainability indicators from the Melbourne Principles, Genuine Progress Indicator, and (Un)happy Planet Index, but they may have very weak correlations. Screens that promote transportation usage, for instance, may prove to have a weak link to improving the GP7-Leisure indicator, unless users are able to realize the leisure benefits of not having to operate a motor-vehicle and can avoid long waits for a bus to arrive. For some the leisure benefit might be strong, but on average it might be minor. However, the positive effects on MP4-Footprint and GP5-Pollution are very real when one uses transit over driving, especially if one stops buying cars. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides the sustainable reach of each urban screen usage, we have to analyze the practicality of getting the data that we are going to display. The various usages can be categorized into four tiers of feasibility.
        <br>
        <br>
        1. The most feasible usages visualize impactful data that is readily available and does not change much. Displays of memorable statistics, like the greenhouse gas emissions pie chart or child poverty rates by region is probably the easiest place to start. These data can share a single screen that cycles through tens of different subjects. One persuasive motivation for cycling through diverse statistics is that it would allow us to connect the issues of environmental and social justice (e.g. neighborhood pollution levels and child poverty, respectively) with green sustainability, seeing their intersection that Agyeman calls "just sustainability" (Agyeman 2005, 10-23). In fact, it would be prudent to order statistics whenever possible to help viewers make the correlations. We might, for example, sequentially display or overlap regional child poverty levels with power plants' particulate pollutants and show regional consumer consumption of the power in terms of CO
        <sub>
            2
        </sub>
        emissions. Caution must be used to avoid insinuating inaccurate cause and effect, but if done properly we could powerfully demonstrate just sustainability.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. The next level up of feasibility is statistical data that is relatively easy to collect but changes frequently. The in-season produce example, which can be supplied with a simple web interface by local stores, is such an example. In fact, any user-generated content that needs little monitoring, like the wildlife reporting example and day-labor postings, would be fairly easy to set up and maintain. Luckily, public and commercial web sites like fixmystreet.com and walkscore.com already do most of the work, and would likely allow their sites to be displayed free of charge. We should keep in mind that the second tier generally needs more dedicated screen time than the first tier. Day-labor postings are not useful if they only display for ten seconds of every ten minutes, and they may need time to scroll through several pages of data and to give job-seekers adequate time to note the information.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. More complicated still are displays that require aggregating complex data, such as air pollutants and noise levels, or displays that require evaluating merit, like the sustainable businesses list. These displays might require expensive infrastructure investment (e.g. pollution sensors), expensive work-hours (e.g. business evaluations), or extensive setup with private businesses (e.g. donations charged to a cell phone bill.) Therefore they should be limited to usages that have strong impacts on sustainability or that generate data that is useful for other purposes. These screen usages may or may not require long periods of dedicated screen space.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. The most complex and expensive data-driven displays, like real time transit data that requires substantial infrastructure investment and maintenance, should be limited to uses that have essential value to peoples' daily lives, as transit displays do. These displays tend to require constant display on screen, or at least on part of the screen, as the Montreal LCD display exhibits. Other complex systems, like the one that measures how citizens arrive to a given area, would probably best be left to manual surveys unless the sensing could be setup and maintained in an inexpensive but accurate way. Such data probably does not change often enough to be useful anyway--yearly trends would adequate. Some complex displays, however, like the "Hole in the Earth" live video chat between countries, might be so provocative that it merits the expense. Very expensive installations like this one could be displayed on portable screens and moved periodically to different neighborhoods or cities. The "Hole in the Earth" display would lend itself especially well to this function, helping different foreign cities get acquainted without the novelty wearing off. Like tier 3, if the data is valuable for other purposes it may be worth the cost.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="recommendations"></a>Recommendations for implementation</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        As mentioned before, it is difficult to give weights to the impact of positively targeting a given indicator. We also have to consider the complex side-effects of positive sustainable awareness, behavior, or government pressure. Returning to public transit, increased bus use may lead to an infrastructure upgrade, which may have negative impact if a new rail yard is constructed in a poor neighborhood. It goes without saying that the cascading effects of any sustainable change are complex, but we have to do the best we can. It is thus with no obvious method of analysis that I make recommendations, other than the aforementioned feasibility levels. I can say that the most useful place to locate the screens is probably in retail areas where a dense population also resides. Downtown business areas that cater to mostly 9 to 5 workers are probably less ideal than neighborhood retail areas with a diverse array of citizens, from children to seniors, homeless to wealthy. Transit displays are the exception, and should be employed as frequently as possible at bus stops and rail stations to encourage usage. They should also be displayed within walking distance of transit to help steer people away from car use. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Of the usages mentioned, the ones that should be implemented first are those that can display preexisting web sites such as walkscore.com. Officials should decide how to best tailor the data to a specific location, which will be obvious for spatial data and less obvious for temporal data. Officials can also work with the web site providers to suit the data to read-only display. Many web-sites offer data in non-graphical form, like XML (extensible markup language) via an API (application program interface) or RSS (really simple syndication), that can be visualized as needed. Next officials should accumulate the tier 1 feasibility data previously mentioned and make a compelling slide show of tens or hundreds of data visualizations. This task is relatively easy and could be accomplished by an intern with minor oversight. After positioning one or more screens and publishing the web-site and tier 1 data, officials should examine the remaining tier 2 data and what tier 3 would be best suited to the situation of the existing screens. They may find that some of the data at these tiers are already available and updated frequently. Finally, tier 4 data should be carefully considered for cost versus benefit before implementing it. The exception is again transit data, since all transit systems should prioritize providing real-time data. Tier 4 data may well be worth implementing if the data or infrastructure has obvious uses beyond a public display or can serve as a copyable prototype.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The topic of urban screens for sustainability purposes needs much more consideration. My ideas are skewed toward mass transit and car-reduction. I am sure citizens from other walks of life can contribute drastically different ideas, and I think any use of urban screens should begin with widespread citizen input. All data should be simple to understand and easy to validate (i.e. trustworthy and publicly accessible data sources should be used.) The screens should, of course, be used in good taste and evaluated frequently through public feedback avenues.

        <p>
            <b>1. Provide a long-term vision for cities based on:sustainability; intergenerational, social, economic and political equity; and their individuality. <a name="MP1"></a><span class="key">MP1-Long-term Vision</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>A long-term vision is the starting point for catalyzing positive change, leading to sustainability. The vision needs to reflect the distinctive nature and characteristics of each city. The vision should also express the shared aspirations of the people for their cities to become more sustainable. It needs to address equity, which means equal access to both natural and human resources, as well as shared responsibility for preserving the value of these resources for future generations. A vision based on sustainability will help align and motivate communities, governments, businesses and others around a common purpose, and will provide a basis for developing a strategy, an action programme and processes to achieve that vision.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Achieve long-term economic and social security. <a name="MP2"></a><span class="key">MP2-Economic&Social</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Long-term economic and social security are prerequisites for beneficial change and are dependent upon environmentally sound,sustainable development. To achieve triple bottom line sustainability,economic strategies need to increase the value and vitality of human and natural systems, and conserve and renew human, financial and natural resources. Through fair allocation of resources, economic strategies should seek to meet basic human needs in a just and equitable manner. In particular, economic strategies should guarantee the right to potable water, clean air, food security, shelter and safe sanitation. Cities are the locus of human diversity; their policies,structures and institutions can significantly contribute to fostering cohesive, stimulating, safe and fulfilled communities.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Recognise the intrinsic value of biodiversity and natural ecosystems, and protect and restore them. <a name="MP3"></a><span class="key">MP3-Biodiversity&Ecosystem</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Nature is more than a commodity for the benefit of humans. We share the Earth with many other life-forms that have their own intrinsic value. They warrant our respect, whether or not they are of immediate benefit to us. It is through people's direct experience with nature that they understand its value and gain a better appreciation of the importance of healthy habitats and ecosystems. This connection provides them with an appreciation of the need to manage our interactions with nature empathetically. Just as humans have the ability to alter the habitat and even to extinguish other species, we can also protect and restore biodiversity. Therefore, we have a responsibility to act as custodians for nature.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Enable communities to minimise their ecological footprint. <a name="MP4"></a><span class="key">MP4-Footprint</span></b>
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            <i>Cities consume significant quantities of resources and have a major impact on the environment, well beyond what they can handle within their borders. These unsustainable trends need to be substantially curbed and eventually reversed. One way of describing the impact of a city is to measure its ecological footprint. The ecological footprint of a city is a measure of the 'load' on nature imposed by meeting the needs of its population. It represents the land are a necessary to sustain current levels of resource consumption and waste discharged by that population. Reducing the ecological footprint of a city is a positive contribution towards sustainability. Like any living system, a community consumes material, water and energy inputs,processes them into usable forms and generates wastes. This is the 'metabolism' of the city and making this metabolism more efficient is essential to reducing the city's ecological footprint. In reducing the footprint, problems should be solved locally where possible, rather than shifting them to other geographic locations or future generations.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. Build on the characteristics of ecosystems in the development and nurturing of healthy and sustainable cities. <a name="MP5"></a><span class="key">MP5-Ecosystem Characteristics</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Cities can become more sustainable by modeling urban processes on ecological principles of form and function, by which natural ecosystems operate. The characteristics of ecosystems include diversity, adaptiveness, interconnectedness, resilience, regenerative capacity and symbiosis. These characteristics can be incorporated by cities in the development of strategies to make them more productive and regenerative, resulting in ecological, social and economic benefits.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6. Recognise and build on the distinctive characteristics of cities, including their human and cultural values, history and natural systems. <a name="MP6"></a><span class="key">MP6-Distinctiveness</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Each city has a distinctive profile of human, cultural, historic and natural characteristics. This profile provides insights on pathways to sustainability that are both acceptable to their people and compatible with their values, traditions, institutions and ecological realities. Building on existing characteristics helps motivate and mobilise the human and physical resources of cities to achieve sustainable development and regeneration.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>7. Empower people and foster participation. <a name="MP7"></a><span class="key">MP7-Participation</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>The journey towards sustainability requires broadly based support. Empowering people mobilises local knowledge and resources and enlists the support and active participation of all who need to be involved in all stages, from long-term planning to implementation of sustainable solutions. People have a right to be involved in the decisions that affect them. Attention needs to be given to empowering those whose voices are not always heard, such as the poor.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. Expand and enable cooperative networks to work towards a common, sustainable future. <a name="MP8"></a><span class="key">MP8-Cooperation</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Strengthening existing networks and establishing new cooperative networks within cities facilitate the transfer of knowledge and support continual environmental improvement. The people of cities are the key drivers for transforming cities towards sustainability. This can be achieved effectively if the people living in cities are well informed,can easily access knowledge and share learning. Furthermore, the energy and talent of people can be enhanced by people working with one another through such networks. There is also value in cities sharing their learning with other cities, pooling resources to develop sustainability tools, and supporting and mentoring one another through inter-city and regional networks. These networks can serve as vehicles for information exchange and encouraging collective effort.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>9. Promote sustainable production and consumption, through appropriate use of environmentally sound technologies and effective demand management. <a name="MP9"></a><span class="key">MP9-Production&Consumption</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>A range of approaches and tools can be used to promote sustainable practices. Demand management, which includes accurate evaluations of natural resources and increasing public awareness, is a valuable strategy to support sustainable consumption. This approach can also provide significant savings in infrastructure investment. Sustainable production can be supported by the adoption and use of environmentally sound technologies which can improve environmental performance significantly. These technologies protect the environment, are less polluting, use resources in a sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products and handle all residual wastes in a more environmentally acceptable way than the technologies for which they are substitutes. Environmentally sound technologies can also be used to drive reduced impacts and enhance value along a supply chain and support businesses embracing product stewardship.</i>

            <i>Good urban governance requires robust processes directed towards achieving the transformation of cities to sustainability through continual improvement. While in some areas gains will be incremental, there are also opportunities to make substantial improvements through innovative strategies, programmes and technologies.</i>

            <h2><img class="backgroundImageLighter" style="top:40px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dgcrc6g5_288f33mnhdq_b">Genuine Progress Indicator - How We Measure Progress</h2>
            <p>
                The GPI starts with the same personal consumption data that the GDP is based on, but then makes some crucial distinctions. It adjusts for factors such as income distribution, adds factors such as the value of household and volunteer work, and subtracts factors such as the costs of crime and pollution. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the GDP and the GPI are both measured in monetary terms, they can be compared on the same scale. Measurements that make up the GPI include:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1. Income Distribution <a name="GP1"></a><span class="key">GP1-Distribution</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Both economic theory and common sense tell us that the poor benefit more from a given increase in their income than do the rich. Accordingly, the GPI rises when the poor receive a larger percentage of national income, and falls when their share decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Housework, Volunteering, and Higher Education <a name="GP2"></a><span class="key">GP2-Housework&Volunteering&Education</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of the most important work in society is done in household and community settings: childcare, home repairs, volunteer work, and so on. The GDP ignores these contributions because no money changes hands. The GPI includes the value of this work figured at the approximate cost of hiring someone to do it. The GPI also takes into account the non-market benefits associated with a more educated population. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Crime <a name="GP3"></a><span class="key">GP3-Crime</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Crime imposes large economic costs on individuals and society in the form of legal fees, medical expenses, damage to property, and the like. The GDP treats such expenses as additions to well-being. By contrast, the GPI subtracts the costs arising from crime. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Resource Depletion <a name="GP4"></a><span class="key">GP4-Resource Depletion</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If today's economic activity depletes the physical resource base available for tomorrow, then it is not creating well-being; rather, it is borrowing it from future generations. The GDP counts such borrowing as current income. The GPI, by contrast, counts the depletion or degradation of wetlands, forests, farmland, and nonrenewable minerals (including oil) as a current cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. Pollution <a name="GP5"></a><span class="key">GP5-Pollution</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The GDP often counts pollution as a double gain: Once when it is created, and then again when it is cleaned up. By contrast, the GPI subtracts the costs of air and water pollution as measured by actual damage to human health and the environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>6. Long-Term Environmental Damage <a name="GP6"></a><span class="key">GP6-Long-term Environmental Damage</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Climate change, ozone depletion, and nuclear waste management are long-term costs arising from the use of fossil fuels, chlorofluorocarbons, and atomic energy, respectively. These costs are unaccounted for in ordinary economic indicators. The GPI treats as costs the consumption of certain forms of energy and of ozone-depleting chemicals. It also assigns a cost to carbon emissions to account for the catastrophic economic, environmental, and social effects of global warming. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>7. Changes in Leisure Time <a name="GP7"></a><span class="key">GP7-Leisure</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                As a nation becomes wealthier, people should have more latitude to choose between work and free time for family or other activities. In recent years, however, the opposite has occurred. The GDP ignores this loss of free time, but the GPI treats leisure as most Americans do�as something of value. When leisure time increases, the GPI goes up; when Americans have less of it, the GPI goes down.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>8. Defensive Expenditures <a name="GP8"></a><span class="key">GP8-Defense</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The GDP counts as additions to well-being the money people spend to prevent erosion in their quality of life or to compensate for misfortunes of various kinds. Examples are the medical and repair bills from automobile accidents, commuting costs, and household expenditures on pollution control devices such as water filters. The GPI counts such "defensive" expenditures as most Americans do: as costs rather than as benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>9. Lifespan of Consumer Durables & Public Infrastructure <a name="GP9"></a><span class="key">GP9-Durables&Infrastructure</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The GDP confuses the value provided by major consumer purchases (e.g., home appliances) with the amount Americans spend to buy them. This hides the loss in well-being that results when products wear out quickly. The GPI treats the money spent on capital items as a cost, and the value of the service they provide year after year as a benefit. This applies both to private capital items and to public infrastructure, such as highways.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>10. Dependence on Foreign Assets <a name="GP10"></a><span class="key">GP10-Foreign Assets</span></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If a nation allows its capital stock to decline, or if it finances consumption out of borrowed capital, it is living beyond its means. The GPI counts net additions to the capital stock as contributions to well-being, and treats money borrowed from abroad as reductions. If the borrowed money is used for investment, the negative effects are canceled out. But if the borrowed money is used to finance consumption, the GPI declines.
